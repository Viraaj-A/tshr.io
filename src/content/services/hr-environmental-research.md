## Backed by Years of Activism, Litigation and Research skills

TSHR’s founder, Viraaj Akuthota, brings extensive experience as a civil litigant in high-profile cases in Australia’s highest courts. With a background as a police accountability activist and community lawyer—ranging from representing First Nations populations to working on refugee cases—Viraaj has contributed novel insights and research to advance human rights and environmental justice.


### Our Approach

- **Innovative, Grounded Research**: We prioritize original, practical research that addresses real-world legal challenges in human rights, climate justice, and refugee law. Our research is crafted to provide actionable insights that stakeholders can implement effectively.

- **Focus on Actionable Output**: We ensure that our research translates into detailed, practical guides and resources. Each publication is aimed at equipping individuals, communities, and organizations with the knowledge to take informed action in their legal and advocacy efforts.

- **Collaborative, Context-Specific Insight**: Drawing on Viraaj’s extensive activism and litigation experience, we work closely with stakeholders to tailor our research to local and global contexts, ensuring our findings are applicable and impactful for diverse audiences.


### Examples

- **[The Racial Profiling Data Monitoring Project](https://www.racialprofilingresearch.org/2019)**: An experimental anti-racism transparency initiative aimed at monitoring Victoria Police’s compliance with its 2015 ban on racial profiling. Viraaj supported project lead Tamar Hopkins in obtaining essential data through litigation against Victoria Police.

- **Displacement Solutions**: As lead author, Viraaj has produced reports for Displacement Solutions on climate change and displacement. These publications are highly actionable, offering comprehensive analyses of [global judicial bodies capable of adjudicating climate-related displacement](https://issuu.com/displacementsolutions/docs/dis6772_uncharted_waters_v3_1) and guidance on how to initiate claims. Additionally, reports include a detailed [global review of climate change cases related to displacement](https://issuu.com/displacementsolutions/docs/climate_displacement_litigation) and strategies for successful litigation at international tribunals.

- **International NGO's and Civil Society Organisations**: Viraaj has developed rights guidebooks focused on fair trial rights and citizenship rights in challenging humanitarian contexts, such as Sittwe, Myanmar.
