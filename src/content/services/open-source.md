## Open Source for a Greater Impact and Accountability

TSHR is committed to advancing human rights and legal technology by developing and sharing open-source tools and datasets. Our open-source approach ensures that critical resources in human rights advocacy, research, and education are available to a broad audience, including communities, NGOs, and researchers who can benefit from free access to innovative tools and datasets.

### Our Approach

- **Transparency and Accessibility**: We make all publicly funded work openly available to foster a collaborative environment. This transparency allows others to inspect, adapt, and build upon our work, contributing to an ecosystem of shared knowledge and advancements.

- **Community-Driven Development**: Our projects are designed with input from diverse stakeholders, including legal professionals, activists, and researchers, ensuring that our tools and datasets meet real-world needs and are developed with the end-user in mind.

- **Continuous Improvement and Collaboration**: By maintaining open-source repositories, we encourage contributions and feedback from the global community, enabling continuous improvement and innovation. This collaborative model ensures our tools evolve to meet emerging needs in human rights and legal tech.

### Examples

- **ECHR RoBERTa Model**: Our [ECHR RoBERTa model](https://huggingface.co/TSHR-MR/roberta_echr_truncated_facts_all_labels) is a fine-tuned version of RoBERTa for analyzing European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases. Itâ€™s trained to predict human rights violations across multiple categories, helping researchers and practitioners to process legal texts more efficiently and with greater accuracy.

- **ECHR Facts Dataset**: The [ECHR Facts dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TSHR-MR/echr_facts) is an extensive collection of case facts from the European Court of Human Rights. This open dataset is structured to support research, machine learning training, and legal analysis, enabling users to explore, benchmark, and innovate on top of rich, relevant data.

- **My Rights Platform**: [My Rights](https://github.com/Viraaj-A/My-Rights) is an open-source project designed to make legal information more accessible. With features like automated web scraping, data visualization, and semantic search, this platform helps users navigate legal documents and databases effectively. Developed with a human-centered approach, My Rights is particularly aimed at enabling access for users who may lack legal expertise.
