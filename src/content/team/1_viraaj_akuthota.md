I'm Viraaj Akuthota, founder of Technology Solutions for Human Rights (TSHR). I bring a unique blend of expertise as an international and domestic human rights lawyer, refugee advocate, and social entrepreneur. Through my work, I strive to leverage technology to make legal frameworks more accessible and empower communities facing injustices.

## Professional Background in Law and Human Rights

My professional journey spans diverse roles and regions, beginning with my work supporting Indigenous communities at the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency in the Northern Territories of Australia. I then served as a solicitor for the Social Action team at Fitzroy Legal Service in Melbourne, focusing on access to justice for marginalized communities. Additionally, my experience includes acting as a human rights consultant for organizations like Save the Children, the INGO Rakhine Initiative, and Justice Base in Myanmar, where I focused on urgent human rights issues such as the Rohingya crisis and the complex legal challenges related to statelessness in Myanmar. My advocacy has also taken me to the international stage, where I represented New Zealand youth at UN conferences in Nairobi.

## Bridging Law and Technology

At TSHR, I lead projects that integrate legal expertise with cutting-edge technology to create tools that promote transparency and accountability. One of our landmark initiatives is My-Rights.info, the world’s first accessible legal database and predictive tool for human rights violations, funded by the German Government. This platform empowers vulnerable populations with easily accessible legal information and provides a predictive model to anticipate and address legal rights violations proactively.

## Experience in Corporate and Financial Law

In addition to my human rights work, I have a background in corporate and financial law, having worked with Ernst & Young in financial services and served as a class actions lawyer in Melbourne. This experience has enhanced my understanding of complex legal environments, further strengthening my capacity to design technology-based solutions that bridge legal and social needs.

## Commitment to Social Justice through Innovation

Throughout my career, I’ve collaborated with diverse partners, including United Nations agencies, governments, NGOs, and grassroots groups, to lead projects that address pressing global issues. This collaborative approach has been central to my work, allowing me to drive impact across various fields and create sustainable, community-centered solutions.
