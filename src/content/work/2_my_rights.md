## My Rights Platform

The My Rights Platform is an open-source tool developed to make European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgments more accessible and navigable for those without legal expertise. Funded by the Prototype Fund and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, this platform uniquely empowers users to explore complex case law, supporting both non-legal professionals and resource-constrained NGOs by streamlining their legal research efforts.

### Approach and Technology

- **Automated Judgment Retrieval**: The platform employs a live dynamic web scraper to automatically download the latest ECtHR judgments, ensuring that users have access to current information without manual updates.

- **Regular Expression Analysis**: Using regular expressions, the tool analyzes unstructured data within judgments, extracting key details to make complex legal information more digestible.

- **Semantic Search Engine**: The built-in semantic search engine provides fast, contextual search functionality, making it easy for users to find relevant cases and understand how different legal precedents connect.

- **Data Visualization Tools**: The platform includes intuitive data visualizations, presenting legal information in accessible formats and allowing for alternative exploration methods beyond traditional text searches.

### Key Features

- **Easy Access for All**: The My Rights Platform is designed for simplicity, allowing anyone—regardless of legal expertise—to gain valuable insights into case law with minimal effort. It is the only free tool that provides this combination of features for ECtHR case law, helping to democratize access to legal information.

- **Supporting NGOs and Community Organizations**: By simplifying access to complex judgments, the platform reduces the research burden on resource-limited NGOs and advocacy groups, allowing them to focus more on substantive work rather than time-intensive case searches.

- **Decolonial Design Principles**: The platform’s design incorporates decolonial thought, prioritizing accessibility for marginalized populations who are often excluded from traditional legal systems. This approach ensures that users from diverse backgrounds can engage meaningfully with human rights information.

- **Open-Source Accessibility and Collaboration**: Built on open-source principles, the platform invites contributions from developers and users worldwide, fostering continuous improvement and ensuring that legal resources are accessible to all.

- **Enhanced Legal Awareness**: By presenting ECtHR case law in a user-friendly format, the platform empowers individuals and communities to understand their rights and the legal precedents that may impact them.

This project exemplifies TSHR’s commitment to bridging the gap between complex legal information and public accessibility, creating a unique tool that supports a more informed and empowered society.
