## Refugee Application: Streamlining Access to Justice for Asylum Seekers

The Refugee Application is a groundbreaking mobile app developed by TSHR to simplify the refugee visa application process in Australia. Addressing the complexities of a 30+ page visa form that is available only in English, this app empowers asylum seekers with limited English proficiency and financial resources to complete the form independently and accurately.

### Purpose and Impact

- **Equitable Access to Justice**: By transforming the refugee application process into a user-friendly digital experience, the Refugee Application reduces the dependency on costly legal assistance. It promotes autonomy for asylum seekers, allowing them to engage directly with the application process and take control of their own legal journey.

- **Decolonial and Inclusive Design**: Reflecting decolonial principles, the app is designed to be accessible and empowering for marginalized individuals. Its intuitive design removes linguistic and financial barriers, ensuring that people from diverse backgrounds can meaningfully participate in the asylum process without needing specialized resources.

- **Support for Resource-Constrained NGOs**: The Refugee Application reduces the administrative workload for NGOs and community organizations, enabling them to focus on the substantive aspects of refugee advocacy. By allowing asylum seekers to complete the form independently, organizations can dedicate more time to high-impact support, such as building legal cases and providing holistic support.

### Key Features

- **Multilingual Support**: The app provides the form in multiple languages, catering to the diverse linguistic needs of asylum seekers and overcoming one of the main obstacles presented by the original English-only document.

- **Built-in Legal Guidance**: Each section of the app includes simplified explanations and legal guidance, helping users understand complex questions and avoid common mistakes. This guidance enhances users’ comprehension, improving the accuracy and completeness of their applications.

- **Intelligent Question Logic**: The app streamlines the application by using question logic to reduce the number of questions based on users’ answers, making the process faster and less overwhelming.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: TSHR is committed to user privacy; the Refugee Application does not store or share any user information, providing a secure experience that respects the user’s right to privacy.

### Real-World Benefits

The Refugee Application enables asylum seekers to gain meaningful access to justice without needing to rely on extensive external support. By saving time for NGOs and other support organizations, this tool allows advocates to provide more substantive and impactful services to those seeking asylum.
