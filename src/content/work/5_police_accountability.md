## Know Your Rights App: Empowering Communities Through Legal Awareness

The **Know Your Rights App** is a mobile application developed by TSHR to provide individuals with clear and accessible legal information regarding police stop and search procedures. This tool is designed to empower users, particularly those from marginalized communities, by enhancing their understanding of their legal rights and promoting equitable access to justice.

### Purpose and Impact

- **Addressing Systemic Bias**: Recognizing the documented biases within the justice system, where non-European populations, especially MƒÅori and Pasifika communities, face higher rates of police apprehension and arrest, the app aims to counteract these disparities by informing individuals of their rights during police encounters. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Enhancing Legal Literacy**: By providing legal information supported by case law, statutes, and police guidelines, the app educates users on their rights, enabling them to navigate police interactions with confidence and knowledge.

- **Promoting Accountability**: The app includes a feature that allows users to covertly audio record interactions with police officers, fostering transparency and accountability during such encounters.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app guides users through a series of simple prompts based on their current situation (e.g., walking or driving), leading them to relevant legal information tailored to their circumstances.

- **Comprehensive Legal Resources**: All legal information is embedded within the app, ensuring users have offline access to essential knowledge without the need for an internet connection.

- **Privacy-Focused Design**: In line with TSHR's commitment to user privacy, the app does not collect, store, or monitor any personal information, ensuring a secure and confidential user experience.

### Real-World Benefits

The Know Your Rights App serves as a vital tool for individuals, particularly those from communities disproportionately affected by policing practices, to assert their rights and seek fair treatment. By providing accessible legal information and tools for accountability, the app contributes to a more informed and empowered populace, fostering trust and transparency between communities and law enforcement.
